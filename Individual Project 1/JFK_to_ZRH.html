                <p class="text-adjust">As I live here in the US, the only way to get to Poland is by plane. However, there were no 
                    direct flights from New York City to Poland, thus I had to take a layover. In this case, the layover was in
                    Zurich, Switzerland. The flight took nearly 8 hours, and I had another 6 hours before my connecting flight to
                    Poland. So, I decided to go into the city of Zurich. The airport was a bit of the way from the city, so I took 
                    a train. Once I got into the city itself, I was astonished at its beauty. It was just as beautiful on the ground
                    as it was seeing it from the sky. I walked the streets admiring the buildings, went into shops and cafes, and of 
                    course tried authentic Swiss chocolate. After my time was up, I headed back to the airport and got to my connecting 
                    flight to Poland.
